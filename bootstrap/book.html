            Long ago, in a time forgotten, a preternatural event threw the seasons out of balance. In a land where
            summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen
            wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister forces are massing beyond the kingdom's protective Wall. To the
            south, the king's powers are failingâ€”his most trusted advisor dead under mysterious circumstances and his
            enemies emerging from the shadows of the throne. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell,
            a family as harsh and unyielding as the frozen land they were born to. Now Lord Eddard Stark is reluctantly
            summoned to serve as the king's new Hand, an appointment that threatens to sunder not only his family but the
            kingdom itself.
